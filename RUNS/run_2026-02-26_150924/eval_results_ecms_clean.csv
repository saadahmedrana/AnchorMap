filip.ttl,mechanical_speed_omega,angular_frequency,0.95,"The OEM variable 'mechanical_speed_omega' typically refers to the angular velocity of a rotating machine, measured in radians per second (rad/s). Among the candidates, 'angular_frequency' is defined with the unit symbol 'rad/s' and matches the physical meaning of 'mechanical_speed_omega'. Other candidates either refer to different physical quantities (e.g., air speed, torque) or use different units (e.g., rpm, rev/s). Therefore, 'angular_frequency' is the most semantically and technically appropriate mapping.",ACCEPT

filip.ttl,stator_current_d_ids,locked_rotor_current,0.5,"The variable 'stator_current_d_ids' most closely matches 'locked_rotor_current' based on the highest similarity score (0.504). Both refer to current measurements related to the stator, and 'locked_rotor_current' is a standard property in motor operating limits. However, the confidence is moderate due to the lack of explicit mention of 'stator' or 'd-axis' in the ontology candidate descriptions.",ACCEPT
filip.ttl,stator_current_q_iqs,locked_rotor_current,0.47,"The OEM variable 'stator_current_q_iqs' most closely matches 'locked_rotor_current' based on the highest similarity score (0.472). Both refer to specific current measurements in the stator, and while 'locked_rotor_current' is not exactly the q-axis stator current, it is the closest available ontology property among the candidates. No candidate directly represents the q-axis stator current, so this is the best available mapping.",ACCEPT
filip.ttl,rotor_flux_d_psi_dr,magnetic_flux,0.46,"The OEM variable 'rotor_flux_d_psi_dr' refers to the d-axis component of the rotor magnetic flux, typically measured in Weber (Wb). Among the candidates, 'magnetic_flux' is the closest match conceptually and by unit (Wb), even though the similarity score is moderate. The other candidates refer to current, torque, or frequency, which are not directly related to magnetic flux.",ACCEPT
filip.ttl,rotor_flux_q_psi_qr,locked_rotor_torque,0.5,"The variable 'rotor_flux_q_psi_qr' appears to relate to the rotor flux in the q-axis, which is a parameter relevant to the electromagnetic behavior of a motor, particularly under dynamic or locked rotor conditions. Among the candidates, 'locked_rotor_torque' has the highest similarity score (0.497) and is associated with motor operating limits, which is contextually closer to rotor flux than the other options. However, the match is not exact, as none of the candidates directly reference rotor flux. The confidence is moderate due to the lack of a perfect match.",ACCEPT
filip.ttl,stator_voltage_d_ud,rated_voltage,0.46,"The OEM variable 'stator_voltage_d_ud' refers to a voltage measurement related to the stator, likely in the d-axis (direct axis) of a motor. Among the candidates, 'rated_voltage' is the only property directly related to voltage, with a similarity score of 0.46. The other candidates refer to torque, current, or flux, which are not directly related to voltage. Therefore, 'rated_voltage' is the best available match, though the confidence is moderate due to the lack of explicit reference to the d-axis or stator in the ontology candidate.",ACCEPT
filip.ttl,stator_voltage_q_uq,rated_voltage,0.46,"The OEM variable 'stator_voltage_q_uq' refers to a voltage measurement related to the stator, likely in the q-axis of a rotating reference frame. Among the candidates, 'rated_voltage' is the closest match as it represents a voltage property relevant to the motor, and its unit (V) aligns with typical stator voltage measurements. The other candidates pertain to torque, current, or flux, which are not directly related to voltage.",ACCEPT
filip.ttl,stator_resistance_Rs,resistance,0.49,"The OEM variable 'stator_resistance_Rs' refers to the resistance of the stator winding in a motor. Among the candidates, 'resistance' is the most relevant ontology property, as it directly represents resistance (with unit ohm) and is associated with the MotorEquivalentCircuit domain, which matches the context of stator resistance. The similarity score is the highest among the candidates, though still moderate, indicating a reasonable but not perfect match.",ACCEPT
filip.ttl,rotor_resistance_Rr,resistance,0.48,"The variable 'rotor_resistance_Rr' refers to the resistance of the rotor in a motor, which aligns with the ontology candidate 'resistance' that is defined as a property of the MotorEquivalentCircuit with unit ohm.

filip.ttl,rated_speed_nn,nn_rpm,0.43,"The OEM variable 'rated_speed_nn' most closely matches the ontology candidate 'nn_rpm', which refers to nominal speed at MCR (Maximum Continuous Rating), free running, measured in rpm. Both variables describe a rated or nominal speed, and the abbreviation 'nn' in both names suggests a direct mapping. However, the similarity score is moderate (0.43), possibly due to differences in domain (MotorRatedPoint vs. Propeller), so the mapping should be verified for context alignment.",HUMAN_REVIEW
