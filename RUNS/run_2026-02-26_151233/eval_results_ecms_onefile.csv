abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power and use the unit kW. The ontology property is sourced from IEC 60034-1:2022 and is defined for MotorRatedPoint, which aligns with typical OEM output power variables.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although the unit is m/s (not rpm), the naming and context suggest it is the closest match in the ontology. The other candidates refer to specific components (e.g., propeller, rudder) or different units, making them less suitable.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' and 'efficiency' are the closest matches. 'efficiency_class_ie' is specifically related to efficiency classification per IEC standards and is associated with the MotorRatedPoint, which is likely relevant for full load conditions. Although 'efficiency' is also a close match, it is tied to Gearbox rather than motors. Therefore, 'efficiency_class_ie' is selected as the best match, but with moderate confidence due to the lack of explicit mention of 'full load' in the ontology description.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the ontology candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score of 0.556) represents the rated torque property for relevant ship components. Although the unit in the ontology is kNm and the OEM variable is in Nm, the semantic meaning aligns closely. Other candidates either refer to general torque or different torque types (e.g., breakdown torque), making 'ratedTorque_kNm' the best match.",ACCEPT
