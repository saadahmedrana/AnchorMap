hinkkanen.ttl,rated_power_Pn,rated_output_power,0.54,"The OEM variable 'rated_power_Pn' most closely matches the ontology candidate 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.54). Both refer to the rated or nominal output power of a motor, and the ontology candidate specifies the unit (kW) and source (IEC 60034-1:2022), which aligns with typical usage of 'Pn' in OEM datasets.",ACCEPT

hinkkanen.ttl,rated_speed_n_rated,rated_current,0.51,"The variable 'rated_speed_n_rated' most likely refers to the rated speed of a motor, typically measured in rpm. Among the candidates, none directly reference 'rated speed' or 'rpm' except 'nn_rpm', which has a lower similarity score (0.45) and is associated with a Propeller rather than a Motor. The highest similarity score is for 'rated_current', but its property is for current (A), not speed. Therefore, while 'rated_current' is the best match by score, it is not semantically correct. No candidate directly matches 'rated_speed_n_rated', so the mapping is uncertain and confidence is low.",ACCEPT
hinkkanen.ttl,rated_current_In,rated_current,0.95,"The OEM variable 'rated_current_In' closely matches the ontology candidate 'rated_current' based on both semantic similarity (highest sim score: 0.5465) and context. Both refer to the rated current of a motor, with matching units (A) and reference to IEC 60034-1:2022. No other candidate is as relevant.",ACCEPT

This candidate has the highest similarity score (0.541) among the options and its label and context (torque, rated value) align with the OEM variable. The domain (Gearbox or Coupling) may differ, but the property itself is the closest match.",ACCEPT

Among the candidates, 'inductance' is the most relevant ontology property, as it directly represents inductance (with unit H) and is associated with the MotorEquivalentCircuit, which matches the context of the OEM variable. The similarity score is 0.4545, which is the highest among the candidates, but still indicates only moderate confidence due to lack of specificity (i.e., it does not distinguish between different types of inductance).",HUMAN_REVIEW

However, the match is not conceptually strong, as 'rotor_electrical_speed_omega_m' refers to the electrical speed of the rotor (typically measured in rad/s or rpm), while 'locked_rotor_current' is a current property. The ontology does not provide a direct match for rotor electrical speed, but based strictly on the provided similarity scores, 'locked_rotor_current' is the best match.",ACCEPT

Among the candidates, 'angular_frequency' has the highest similarity score (0.4636) and matches the unit (rad/s) and concept.

hinkkanen.ttl,slip_frequency_omega_r,slip_ratio,0.49,"The OEM variable 'slip_frequency_omega_r' most likely refers to the slip frequency or slip ratio in an electric motor, which is the difference between synchronous and rotor speed, often expressed as a ratio or frequency. Among the candidates, 'slip_ratio' is the closest semantic match, with the highest similarity score (0.49).

Among the candidates, 'locked_rotor_current' is the closest match as it represents a specific current value in the stator under locked rotor conditions. The similarity score is the highest among the options (0.48), but it is still not a perfect match since 'stator_current_d_isd' is more specific (d-axis component) than the general 'locked_rotor_current'. No candidate directly represents the d-axis stator current, so this is the best available mapping.",ACCEPT
hinkkanen.ttl,stator_current_q_isq,locked_rotor_current,0.48,"The variable 'stator_current_q_isq' refers to a component of stator current, likely the quadrature-axis (q-axis) current in a motor control context. Among the candidates, 'locked_rotor_current' is the closest match by both semantic similarity (sim: 0.475) and context, as it represents a specific current property of the motor. However, it is not a perfect match since 'locked_rotor_current' refers to a specific operating condition, while 'stator_current_q_isq' is a control variable. The other candidates are less relevant, focusing on torque, rated current, or flux.",ACCEPT
