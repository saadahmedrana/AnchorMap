Both refer to output power in kilowatts, and 'rated_output_power' explicitly uses the unit kW and is sourced from IEC 60034-1:2022, which aligns with typical OEM terminology for motor output power.",ACCEPT
weg_w22.ttl,full_load_torque_n_m,torque,0.49,"The OEM variable 'full_load_torque_n_m' refers to the torque at full load, measured in Newton-meters (Nm). Among the candidates, 'torque' has a matching unit (Nm) and is defined as a property for MotorRatedPoint, which aligns with the context of full load operation. The similarity score (0.485) is the highest among candidates with matching units and relevant domain, making it the best fit.",ACCEPT

Both refer to the current drawn by a motor under locked rotor conditions, and the ontology definition aligns with the OEM variable's context.",ACCEPT
weg_w22.ttl,locked_rotor_torque_Tl_Tn,locked_rotor_torque,0.61,"The OEM variable 'locked_rotor_torque_Tl_Tn' refers to locked rotor torque, which matches the ontology candidate 'locked_rotor_torque' both in terminology and context (motor operating limits, unit: pu).

Among the candidates, 'rotational_frequency' has the unit symbol 'rpm' and is defined as a property of MotorRatedPoint, which aligns with the context of rated speed. The other candidates either refer to different domains (e.g., propeller, prime mover) or different quantities (e.g., voltage, power).
