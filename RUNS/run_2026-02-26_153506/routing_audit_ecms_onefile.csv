abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,ACCEPT,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power with the unit kW, and 'rated_output_power' is defined as a property for MotorRatedPoint, which aligns with typical OEM output power variables. The unit and context are consistent, making this the best mapping.",LLM,0.5524781346321106,0.038175761699676514,"[{""id"": ""rated_output_power"", ""sim"": 0.5525}, {""id"": ""output_power"", ""sim"": 0.5143}, {""id"": ""input_power"", ""sim"": 0.4642}, {""id"": ""mcrPower_kW"", ""sim"": 0.4642}, {""id"": ""copper_losses"", ""sim"": 0.4412}]"
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although the unit is 'm_per_s' rather than 'r/min', the semantic match on 'minimum speed' is closest. The other candidates refer to specific components (e.g., propeller, rudder) or use different units or contexts. Therefore, 'minimum_air_speed' is selected as the best available match, but the confidence is moderate due to the unit mismatch and possible domain differences.",LLM,0.5065497159957886,0.04091024398803711,"[{""id"": ""minimum_air_speed"", ""sim"": 0.5065}, {""id"": ""mcrRpm_revPerSec"", ""sim"": 0.4656}, {""id"": ""reg:CI_RudderSpeedMinima"", ""sim"": 0.4628}, {""id"": ""shape:rudderSpeedMinima"", ""sim"": 0.4569}, {""id"": ""nn_rpm"", ""sim"": 0.4371}]"

Among the candidates, 'efficiency' is the most direct match, representing a property with a decimal range, which aligns with typical efficiency values. The similarity score is highest among relevant candidates, and the domain (Gearbox) is generic enough to potentially cover motor efficiency, though domain alignment may need further validation.",LLM,0.45635348558425903,0.00029730796813964844,"[{""id"": ""efficiency_class_ie"", ""sim"": 0.4564}, {""id"": ""efficiency"", ""sim"": 0.4561}, {""id"": ""power_factor"", ""sim"": 0.4248}, {""id"": ""copper_losses"", ""sim"": 0.4119}, {""id"": ""rated_output_power"", ""sim"": 0.4076}]"

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the ontology candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score) represents the rated torque property for relevant ship components. Although the unit in the ontology is kNm and the OEM variable is in Nm, the semantic meaning aligns closely.
