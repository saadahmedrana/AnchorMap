lassi.ttl,power_P_N,power_factor,0.48,"The variable 'power_P_N' likely refers to the nominal power factor, as indicated by the 'P_N' suffix (commonly used for nominal values) and the highest similarity score among candidates. The ontology candidate 'power_factor' has a unit symbol 'pu' (per unit), which aligns with typical representations of power factor. Other candidates refer to power quantities (output, input, rated), but 'power_factor' is the closest semantic match.",ACCEPT

lassi.ttl,torque_T_N,torque,0.95,"The OEM variable 'torque_T_N' represents torque in Newton-meters (Nm), which directly matches the ontology candidate 'torque' with unitSymbol Nm and a relevant domain (MotorRatedPoint). The similarity score is the highest among candidates, and the unit and context align precisely.",ACCEPT
lassi.ttl,frequency_f_N,naturalFrequency_Hz,0.45,"The OEM variable 'frequency_f_N' likely refers to a natural frequency, as suggested by the '_N' suffix. Among the candidates, 'naturalFrequency_Hz' is the closest semantic match, with a similarity score of 0.4476. The description also references vibration natural frequency, which aligns with typical engineering nomenclature for 'f_N'. The other candidates refer to general frequency, angular frequency, or sampling rate, which are less specific to natural frequency.",HUMAN_REVIEW

lassi.ttl,input_power_P1,input_power,0.51,"The OEM variable 'input_power_P1' most closely matches the ontology property 'input_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5104). Both refer to the input power of a motor, and the ontology property specifies the same unit (W) and relevant domain. Other candidates have lower similarity and do not directly reference input power.",ACCEPT
lassi.ttl,shaft_power_P2,output_power,0.85,"The OEM variable 'shaft_power_P2' refers to the mechanical power delivered by the shaft, which is commonly termed as 'output power' in motor and machinery contexts. Among the candidates, 'output_power' has the highest similarity score and its definition aligns with the concept of shaft power, as it represents the power output from the motor shaft. The unit (W) and source (IEC 60034-2-1:2024) further support this mapping.",ACCEPT

lassi.ttl,stator_current_vector_i_s,locked_rotor_current,0.48,"The variable 'stator_current_vector_i_s' refers to the stator current, which is most closely related to 'locked_rotor_current' among the candidates. 'locked_rotor_current' represents a specific operational current of the stator under locked rotor conditions, and its description matches the context of stator current more closely than the other options. The similarity score (0.48) is the highest among the candidates, but the match is not perfect since 'stator_current_vector_i_s' could refer to a general stator current vector, not necessarily under locked rotor conditions.",ACCEPT
