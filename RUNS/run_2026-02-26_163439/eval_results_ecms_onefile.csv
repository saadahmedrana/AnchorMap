abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power in kilowatts, and 'rated_output_power' explicitly uses the unit kW, aligning with the OEM variable. The domain and source are also relevant for motor output power.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although its unit is m/s and domain is ElectricMotor, the naming and description most closely match the concept of a minimum speed. The other candidates refer to specific contexts (e.g., MCR rotational speed, rudder speed minima) or have lower similarity scores.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device (likely a motor) at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' is most closely related, as it is an efficiency property associated with a motor's rated point and references the IEC standard for efficiency classes. Although the similarity score is moderate, it is the most relevant match given the context.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the ontology candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score of 0.556) represents the rated torque property for relevant ship components. The only difference is the unit (Nm vs kNm), which can be converted. Other candidates either refer to general torque, breakdown torque, or maximum torque, which do not match the 'rated' qualifier as closely.",ACCEPT
