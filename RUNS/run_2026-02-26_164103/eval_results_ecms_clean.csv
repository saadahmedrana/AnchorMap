abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power in kilowatts, and the ontology property explicitly uses the unit kW, aligning with the OEM variable. The domain and source are also relevant for motor rated points, which is consistent with typical OEM datasets.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although the unit (m/s) and domain (ElectricMotor) may not perfectly match the OEM context, the semantic alignment on 'minimum' and 'speed' makes it the closest fit among the provided options.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device (likely a motor) at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' and 'efficiency' are most relevant. 'efficiency_class_ie' is specifically related to motor efficiency classes as per IEC standards and is associated with the MotorRatedPoint domain, which aligns with typical OEM datasets. Although 'efficiency' is also relevant, it is tied to Gearbox, making 'efficiency_class_ie' the closest match. The confidence is moderate due to the similarity score and partial alignment in domain.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the ontology candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score of 0.556) represents rated torque as well. Although the ontology uses kNm as the unit, the semantic meaning aligns closely. The other candidates either refer to general torque, breakdown torque, or maximum torque, which are less specific matches.",ACCEPT
