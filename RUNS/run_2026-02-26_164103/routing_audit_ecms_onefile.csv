abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,ACCEPT,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power in kilowatts, and the ontology property explicitly uses the unit kW, aligning with the OEM variable.

abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51).

abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device (likely a motor) at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' and 'efficiency' are most relevant. 'efficiency_class_ie' is specifically related to motor efficiency classes as per IEC standards and is associated with the MotorRatedPoint domain, which aligns with typical OEM datasets. Although 'efficiency' is also relevant, it is tied to Gearbox, making 'efficiency_class_ie' the closest match. The confidence is moderate due to the similarity score and partial alignment in domain.",LLM,0.4563223421573639,0.00024962425231933594,"[{""id"": ""efficiency_class_ie"", ""sim"": 0.4563}, {""id"": ""efficiency"", ""sim"": 0.4561}, {""id"": ""power_factor"", ""sim"": 0.4248}, {""id"": ""copper_losses"", ""sim"": 0.4118}, {""id"": ""rated_output_power"", ""sim"": 0.4075}]"
