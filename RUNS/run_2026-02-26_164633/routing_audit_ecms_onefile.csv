Both refer to output power in kilowatts (kW), and the ontology property explicitly uses the unit symbol 'kW' and references a relevant IEC standard.

abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a speed measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). Among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51), but its unit is meters per second (m_per_s) and is related to air speed, not rotational speed. None of the candidates exactly match the concept of rotational speed in rpm. However, based on similarity score alone, 'minimum_air_speed' is the closest, though the mapping is not ideal due to the unit and domain mismatch.",LLM,0.5065497159957886,0.04091024398803711,"[{""id"": ""minimum_air_speed"", ""sim"": 0.5065}, {""id"": ""mcrRpm_revPerSec"", ""sim"": 0.4656}, {""id"": ""reg:CI_RudderSpeedMinima"", ""sim"": 0.4628}, {""id"": ""shape:rudderSpeedMinima"", ""sim"": 0.4569}, {""id"": ""nn_rpm"", ""sim"": 0.4371}]"
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency,0.46,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a component (likely a motor or gearbox) at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency' (sim: 0.456) is the closest match, representing a property for efficiency with a decimal value. Although its domain is 'Gearbox', it is more semantically aligned with the OEM variable than the other candidates, which refer to efficiency class, power factor, or losses.",LLM,0.4563027620315552,0.0003217458724975586,"[{""id"": ""efficiency_class_ie"", ""sim"": 0.4563}, {""id"": ""efficiency"", ""sim"": 0.456}, {""id"": ""power_factor"", ""sim"": 0.4248}, {""id"": ""copper_losses"", ""sim"": 0.4118}, {""id"": ""rated_output_power"", ""sim"": 0.4075}]"

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque in Newton-meters. Among the candidates, 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with a similarity score of 0.556) is the closest match, as it represents the rated torque property for relevant ship components (Gearbox, Coupling). Although the ontology property uses kilonewton-meters (kNm) as the unit, this is a straightforward unit conversion from Nm.
