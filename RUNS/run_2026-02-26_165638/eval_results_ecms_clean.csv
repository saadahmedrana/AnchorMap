abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power with the unit kW, and 'rated_output_power' is specifically defined for motor rated points, which aligns with typical OEM usage. The other candidates either have lower similarity scores or refer to input power, losses, or different domains.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although the unit (m/s) and domain (ElectricMotor) may not perfectly match the OEM context, the semantic alignment on 'minimum' and 'speed' makes it the closest available ontology property.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a component (likely a motor) at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' is most closely related, as it is a property associated with motor rated points and references efficiency classification per IEC standards. Although the similarity score is not very high, it is the highest among the candidates and contextually relevant.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the ontology candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score of 0.556) represents rated torque as well. Although the ontology uses kNm as the unit, the semantic meaning aligns closely. The other candidates either refer to general torque, breakdown torque, or maximum torque, which are not as specific to the 'rated' context.",ACCEPT
