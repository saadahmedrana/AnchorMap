abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power in kilowatts, and the ontology property specifies the unit as kW, aligning with the OEM variable. The domain and range are also appropriate for motor output power.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although the unit (m/s) and domain (ElectricMotor) may not perfectly match the OEM context (which could be rotational speed in rpm), the label and intent align best with the variable name. The other candidates either refer to specific components (e.g., propeller, rudder) or have lower similarity scores.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The variable 'Efficiency_full_load' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'efficiency_class_ie' based on the highest similarity score (0.456). Both refer to efficiency at a specific operating point (full load), and 'efficiency_class_ie' is defined for a motor rated point, which aligns with the context of full load efficiency. The other candidates either refer to efficiency in a different context (e.g., gearbox), or to unrelated properties such as power factor or losses.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score) represents the rated torque property in the ontology. Although the unit in the ontology is kNm and the OEM variable is in Nm, the semantic meaning aligns closely. The domain (Gearbox or Coupling) should be further specified based on the equipment context, but 'ratedTorque_kNm' is the best available match.",ACCEPT
