abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5525). Both refer to output power in kilowatts (kW), and 'rated_output_power' is defined with the unit symbol kW and sourced from IEC 60034-1:2022, which aligns with typical OEM terminology for motor output power.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value. Among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51) and describes a minimum speed property, although its unit is m/s and domain is ElectricMotor. The other candidates relate to rotational speed (rpm or rev/s) or rudder speed minima, but their similarity scores are lower. The mapping is not perfect, but 'minimum_air_speed' is the closest match based on the provided scores and descriptions.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a motor at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' is most closely related, as it represents an efficiency property within the domain of MotorRatedPoint, which aligns with full load conditions. The similarity score is the highest among the candidates, and the domain context is appropriate.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' most closely matches the ontology property 'ratedTorque_kNm' based on the highest similarity score (0.556). Both refer to rated torque, though the ontology property uses kNm as the unit while the OEM variable uses Nm. The context of 'rated torque' is preserved, making this the best available mapping among the candidates.",ACCEPT
