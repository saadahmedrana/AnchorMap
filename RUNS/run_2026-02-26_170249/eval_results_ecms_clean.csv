abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The OEM variable 'Output_kW' most closely matches the ontology property 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.55). Both refer to output power in kilowatts, and the ontology property explicitly uses the unit kW and is sourced from IEC 60034-1:2022, which is relevant for motor rated points. The other candidates either have lower similarity scores or use different units/domains.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although the unit is m/s (not rpm), the label and context of 'minimum' and 'speed' align best with the variable name. The other candidates either refer specifically to rotational speed in different units or to rudder speed minima, which are less likely matches based on the variable name alone.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a component (likely a motor) at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' is most closely related, as it represents an efficiency property within the motor domain and references IEC standards for efficiency classification. Although the similarity score is not very high, it is the highest among the candidates and contextually relevant.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and among the candidates, 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score of 0.556) is the closest semantic match. Both represent rated torque, though the ontology property uses kNm as the unit. The other candidates either refer to general torque, breakdown torque, or maximum torque, which are not exact matches for 'rated' torque.",ACCEPT
