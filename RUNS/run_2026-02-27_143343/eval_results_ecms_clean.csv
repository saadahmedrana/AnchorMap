hinkkanen.ttl,rated_power_Pn,rated_output_power,0.54,"The OEM variable 'rated_power_Pn' most closely matches the ontology property 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.54). Both refer to the rated or nominal output power of a motor, and the ontology property explicitly uses the term 'rated' and specifies the unit as kW, which aligns with typical usage for 'Pn'.",ACCEPT

hinkkanen.ttl,rated_speed_n_rated,rated_current,0.505,"The variable 'rated_speed_n_rated' most closely matches 'rated_current' based on the highest similarity score among the candidates. However, the match is not ideal as 'rated_speed_n_rated' likely refers to rated speed (rpm), while 'rated_current' refers to electrical current (A). None of the candidates directly represent rated speed, but 'rated_current' is selected strictly by similarity score.",ACCEPT
hinkkanen.ttl,rated_current_In,rated_current,0.55,"The OEM variable 'rated_current_In' closely matches the ontology candidate 'rated_current' based on semantic similarity (sim=0.546).

hinkkanen.ttl,stator_resistance_Rs,resistance,0.49,"The OEM variable 'stator_resistance_Rs' refers to the electrical resistance of the stator winding in a motor. Among the candidates, 'resistance' is the most relevant ontology property, as it directly represents resistance (with unit ohm) and is associated with the MotorEquivalentCircuit domain, which matches the context of stator resistance. The similarity score is the highest among the candidates, though not very high, indicating a moderate match.",ACCEPT
hinkkanen.ttl,rotor_resistance_RR,resistance,0.47,"The OEM variable 'rotor_resistance_RR' refers to the resistance of the rotor in a motor, which aligns with the ontology candidate 'resistance' that is defined as a property of the MotorEquivalentCircuit with unit ohm. Although the similarity score is moderate, it is the most semantically appropriate match among the candidates, as the other options pertain to current, torque, losses, or temperature rise rather than electrical resistance.",ACCEPT

While the ontology candidate is general, it is defined for the MotorEquivalentCircuit domain and uses the correct unit (H), making it the best available match among the candidates. The similarity score is moderate, reflecting the generality of the ontology term compared to the specificity of the OEM variable.",HUMAN_REVIEW

However, the match is not conceptually ideal, as 'rotor_electrical_speed_omega_m' refers to the electrical speed of the rotor, typically measured in rad/s or rpm, while 'locked_rotor_current' is a current property. None of the candidates directly represent rotor electrical speed, but 'locked_rotor_current' is the closest by score.",ACCEPT

The similarity score is highest for 'locked_rotor_current' (0.45), and both involve current measurements in the stator circuit. However, the match is not perfect, as 'stator_current_space_vector_is' may represent instantaneous or vector current, while 'locked_rotor_current' is a specific operating limit.

Among the candidates, 'slip_ratio' has the highest similarity score and is directly related to slip, making it the best match. However, the confidence is moderate because 'slip_frequency_omega_r' suggests a frequency (rad/s), while 'slip_ratio' is a unitless ratio.",ACCEPT

Among the candidates, 'locked_rotor_current' is the closest match based on the similarity score (0.48) and the fact that it represents a current property related to the stator. However, the match is not exact, as 'locked_rotor_current' typically refers to the current when the rotor is not moving, while 'stator_current_d_isd' is more general. No candidate directly represents the d-axis stator current, so this is the best available mapping.",ACCEPT
hinkkanen.ttl,stator_current_q_isq,locked_rotor_current,0.48,"The variable 'stator_current_q_isq' refers to the q-axis component of the stator current, which is related to the current in the motor. Among the candidates, 'locked_rotor_current' has the highest similarity score (0.475) and is the closest match, as it represents a specific current property of the motor. However, the match is not exact since 'locked_rotor_current' refers to a specific operating condition, while 'stator_current_q_isq' is a general current component. The confidence is moderate due to this partial alignment.",ACCEPT
