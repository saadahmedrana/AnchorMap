abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The OEM variable 'Output_kW' most closely matches the ontology property 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.552) and the matching unit symbol (kW). The domain and range are also appropriate for motor output power, and the source aligns with IEC standards for rated power.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although its unit is m/s and domain is ElectricMotor, the naming and description most closely match the intent of the OEM variable compared to other candidates, which are more specific to rudder or propeller speeds or use different units or contexts.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' and 'efficiency' are most relevant. 'efficiency_class_ie' is specifically related to efficiency classification per IEC standards and is associated with the MotorRatedPoint, which is likely the context for full load efficiency. Although 'efficiency' is also relevant, it is tied to Gearbox, which may not match the OEM context. Therefore, 'efficiency_class_ie' is selected as the best match, but with moderate confidence due to the similarity score and possible ambiguity in domain.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the ontology candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score) represents the rated torque property for relevant ship components. Although the unit in the ontology is kNm and the OEM variable is in Nm, the semantic meaning aligns closely. The other candidates either refer to general torque, breakdown torque, or maximum torque, which are less specific matches for 'rated' torque.",ACCEPT
