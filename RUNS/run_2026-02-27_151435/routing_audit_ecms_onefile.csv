abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51).

abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,ACCEPT,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' and 'efficiency' are most relevant. 'efficiency_class_ie' is specifically related to efficiency classification per IEC standards and is associated with the MotorRatedPoint, which is likely the context for full load efficiency. Although 'efficiency' is also relevant, it is tied to Gearbox, which may not match the OEM context. Therefore, 'efficiency_class_ie' is selected as the best match, but with moderate confidence due to the similarity score and possible ambiguity in domain.",LLM,0.4563223421573639,0.00024962425231933594,"[{""id"": ""efficiency_class_ie"", ""sim"": 0.4563}, {""id"": ""efficiency"", ""sim"": 0.4561}, {""id"": ""power_factor"", ""sim"": 0.4248}, {""id"": ""copper_losses"", ""sim"": 0.4118}, {""id"": ""rated_output_power"", ""sim"": 0.4075}]"
