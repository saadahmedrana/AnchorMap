abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power and use the unit kW. The ontology property is defined for motors and references IEC 60034-1:2022, which aligns with typical OEM output power specifications.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). Although its unit is m/s and domain is ElectricMotor, the name and context align best with a minimum speed variable. The other candidates either refer to specific components (e.g., propeller, rudder) or use different units or contexts.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a component (likely a motor) at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' is most closely related, as it represents an efficiency property associated with a motor's rated point and references the IEC standard for efficiency classes. The similarity score is the highest among the candidates, though still moderate, indicating a partial but not perfect match.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the ontology candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score of 0.556) represents the rated torque property for relevant ship components. Although the unit in the ontology is kNm and the OEM variable is in Nm, the semantic meaning aligns closely. Other candidates either refer to general torque, breakdown torque, or maximum torque, which are less specific matches for 'rated' torque.",ACCEPT
