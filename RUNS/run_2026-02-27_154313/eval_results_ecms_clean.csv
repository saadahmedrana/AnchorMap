abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power in kilowatts, and 'rated_output_power' explicitly uses the unit kW and is sourced from IEC 60034-1:2022, which aligns with typical OEM terminology for motor output power.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51). However, the unit (m_per_s) and domain (ElectricMotor) may not perfectly match the OEM variable, which could be in rpm. The mapping is based on textual similarity rather than exact semantic alignment.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device (likely a motor) at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' is most closely related, as it represents an efficiency property for motors and references IEC standards. Although the similarity score is not very high, it is the highest among the candidates and aligns with the context of efficiency at a specific operating point.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and among the candidates, 'ratedTorque_kNm' is the closest semantic match. Although the ontology property uses kNm as the unit while the OEM variable uses Nm, the property name and context (rated torque) align best. The similarity score (0.556) is the highest among the candidates, supporting this mapping. Unit conversion may be required in implementation.",ACCEPT
