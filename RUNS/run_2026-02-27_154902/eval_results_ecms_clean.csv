abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5525). Both refer to output power in kilowatts (kW), and the ontology candidate explicitly uses the unit kW and references a relevant IEC standard. Other candidates either have lower similarity scores or use different units (W) or refer to input power or losses, which are not equivalent to output power.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed value. Among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest similarity score (0.51) and describes a minimum speed property, although its unit is m/s and domain is ElectricMotor. The other candidates relate to rotational speed or rudder speed minima but have lower similarity scores. Therefore, 'minimum_air_speed' is selected as the best match based on similarity and concept alignment.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' and 'efficiency' are the closest matches. 'efficiency_class_ie' is specifically related to efficiency classification per IEC standards and is associated with the MotorRatedPoint, which is likely relevant for full load conditions. Although 'efficiency' is also a close match, it is tied to Gearbox rather than motors. Therefore, 'efficiency_class_ie' is selected as the best match, but with moderate confidence due to the lack of explicit mention of 'full load' in the ontology candidates.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,torque,0.52,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' most closely matches the ontology property 'torque', which has a unit symbol of Nm and is sourced from ISO 80000-4:2019. Although the similarity score is slightly lower than 'ratedTorque_kNm', 'torque' uses the same unit (Nm) as the OEM variable, making it a more precise mapping. The other candidates either use different units (kNm, pu) or refer to different concepts (breakdown torque, maximum torque).",ACCEPT
