abb_gen.ttl,Output_kW,rated_output_power,0.55,"The variable 'Output_kW' from the OEM dataset most closely matches 'rated_output_power' based on the highest similarity score (0.5524781346321106). Both refer to output power in kilowatts, and the ontology property explicitly uses the unit 'kW', aligning with the OEM variable. The domain and source (IEC 60034-1:2022) are also relevant for motor rated points, which is likely the context for 'Output_kW'.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Speed_r_min,minimum_air_speed,0.51,"The OEM variable 'Speed_r_min' likely refers to a minimum speed, and among the candidates, 'minimum_air_speed' has the highest semantic similarity (sim: 0.51). However, its unit is meters per second (m_per_s), which may not directly match 'r/min' (revolutions per minute). The other candidates reference rotational speed or rudder speed minima, but their similarity scores are lower. Therefore, 'minimum_air_speed' is selected as the best match based on similarity, but the unit mismatch should be reviewed.",ACCEPT
abb_gen.ttl,Efficiency_full_load,efficiency_class_ie,0.46,"The OEM variable 'Efficiency_full_load' refers to the efficiency of a device at full load. Among the candidates, 'efficiency_class_ie' is most closely related, as it represents an efficiency property (likely at a specific operating point) and is sourced from a relevant IEC standard. The similarity score is the highest among the candidates, though still moderate, indicating a partial but not perfect match.",ACCEPT

abb_gen.ttl,rated_torque_Nm,ratedTorque_kNm,0.56,"The OEM variable 'rated_torque_Nm' refers to the rated torque, and the ontology candidate 'ratedTorque_kNm' (with the highest similarity score of 0.556) represents rated torque as well. Although the unit in the ontology is kNm and the OEM variable is in Nm, the semantic meaning aligns closely. The domain (Gearbox or Coupling) may need further context, but 'ratedTorque_kNm' is the best available match among the candidates.",ACCEPT
